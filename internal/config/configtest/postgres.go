// PostgresPreset is the PostgreSQL configuration shared by integration tests,
// such as the DAO tests. Those run under postgres.RunDBTest: the migration set is
// applied once into a template database, and each test gets its own clone of it,
// dropped afterward — so tests never observe each other's writes. No transaction
// is opened, and postgres.InTx reports false, which is what a data-access object
// gating an outbound call needs.
//
// It lives in a regular (non-_test.go) file so other packages' tests can import
// it: Go excludes _test.go files from a package's exported surface. Keeping
// production code out of configtest is a convention enforced in review.
